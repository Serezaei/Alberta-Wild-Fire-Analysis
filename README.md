# Alberta-Wild-Fire-Analysis
Hypothesis Testing and Data Visualization in Python

Introduction

This project is about analyzing the affect of year and latitude on the size of the wildfires that happens in the month of May between 210 and 2021 in province of Alberta, Canada. The dataset is collected from website of Government of Alberta and is available with other resources in the repository.
Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation Coefficient Analysis is used for analyzing the affect of year and latitude on the size of the wildfires and data visualization is used to give a better grasp of the mentioned correlations. I used Python and libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Scypi for this Analysis
